ToDo List (for 0.8.0 release, future for future php):

-------------------- Balance
1)add ressize to crabs --Done. Added new primitive theme, possibility to get naked crabs, themes chance redone and nerf of baseprot (15->10), morale (13->9). Also ressize 4 for them
2)make illhybrids RP cheaper --Done
3)do something with taurs
4)summoning sites are better (but mb not only them) --Done
future) do the same thing to nagas as to illhybrids ---Done
future) fix atlantian flag bearers by making new role or just look at imperial humans for how it should be done ---Done
future) also separate mutated crabs into different role
5)do something with horses being too expensive --- Done, 20% reduction in rp, which went to 50% reduction and then custom system
future) solve problem of atlantian sacreds having bare standard sometimes? Flag parade is still here
future) balance out invisibility. Do something with spiritsighth, or at least define canceinc paths for the trait etc
future) make scouts\assasins possibly invisible lol (probably shouldnt)

-------------------- Code
1)remove magic:acces button (or at least check what it do) --Done. problem was already fixed for 0.7.13
2)update nation descriptions and version to NG-N --Done
3)themes should be written in nat descr --Done
future)Extract color used for troops and put it somewhere in DM sebug section at least, or even use in scoregraphs
4) Fix montag units descriptions to not be empty at least + add montag number in it, instead of preview site. It needs free symbols badly
future) description for supplicants
future) i pretty much messed in claculateRP in unit.java so for better performance it should be tweaked. mount1 section returns 0s for unknown reason. Check for chariot role and oversee custom cost gen
ie probably redo this thing. Check if it affects cost of high-ranked commanders (they should have 2rp, but have 1)

-------------------- Mixed (Hardest)
1)add PREVIEW sites for montag units (foulspawns) --Done
2)sacred power slider now will do something --Done (thnks geepope)
3)generate uwrec units for uwbuild nations.

//Check soulless shambler, so in future not only void and mutated themes, but also damned. or smth u know
//make different natgen presets for future dom6 and natgenverse
