A rough guide how to open Natgen project in eclipse.

1: get Eclipse IDE, it should be version for java (you chosen it during installagtion)
2: Create a folder somwhere that will be Eclipse workspace (btw its not the only way)
3: Clone NationGen-N repo into this workspace (In Git Desktop choose to contribute into right place, dont forget)
4: Open Eclipse and choose workspace (ur folder containing folder of cloned natgen) as your workspace.
5: On the main screen choose to import existing git project
6: Choose a local one and point at cloned natgen folder
7: it should find some .git file.  Confirm
8: You should get your project now opened.

add Junit4 into building path if its not here (this thing is used for debugging. in srctest etc)

=========================
So, to run the program you need to right click on NationGen-N project at the top and shoose a 'run as' option.
There you can ran it as a java application (to start it as an executable), however you need to chose which thing you want to ran.
nationgen GUI (GUI-nationgen.GUI it will be at the top) or spritegen are probably the things you wanted to run
as the first one is application itself.

Second option it to run it as a Junit thing. its a debugging tool that uses srctest to check data and other stuff as far as i understood it
