A rough guide how to open Natgen project in eclipse.  Made by Dark Spark after several days of suffering.

1: get Eclipse IDE, it should be version for java (you chosen it during installagtion)
2: Create a folder somwhere that will be Eclipse workspace (btw its not the only way)
3: Clone NationGen-N repo into this workspace (In Git Desktop choose to contribute into right place, dont forget)
4: Open Eclipse and choose workspace (ur folder containing folder of cloned natgen) as your workspace.
5: On the main screen choose to import existing git project
6: Choose a local one and point at cloned natgen folder
7: it should find some .git file.  Confirm
8: You should get your project now opened.

add Junit4 into building path if its not here (this thing is used for debugging. in srctest etc)

9: natgen is a Maven Project, so if it doesnt have something like "Maven Dependancies" or srctest spotted with wrong package declaration
then convert Eclipse project to Maven project. You can do it in File>Convert or just google it.
10: Actually its ready to use. In run-as you will have some maven options, i recommend (but not sure) to add this configuration: First R click on project>run-as>maven build...
11: Set user settings to our pom.xml and as goals "Clean Verify" without "" and also you can make your name for this launch configuration.
12: uhh add OpenJDK 11.0.2 somewhere and make in pom.xml JAVA_PATh argument for release-all.bat to be link to JDK like "C:\Users\User\Desktop\Natgen\jdk-11.0.2" 

and btw JDK is only for purposes of compiling as original bats were created long ago and now uncompitible with modern solutions, at least because they lack jmods folder.
=========================
So, to run the program you need to right click on NationGen-N project at the top and shoose a 'run as' option.
There you can ran it as a java application (to start it as an executable), however you need to chose which thing you want to ran.
nationgen GUI (GUI-nationgen.GUI it will be at the top) or spritegen are probably the things you wanted to run
as the first one is application itself.

Second option it to run it as a Junit thing. its a debugging tool that uses srctest to check data and other stuff as far as i understood it

Plus there are several other useful thing you sometimes want to run.
Also in core folder "mods" will appear if you generated something, here will be your generated packs you made within eclipse
=========================
To change version. you need to change it in src>nationGen>NationGen and also in pom.xml.
To compile project, or make a release you need to build a Maven project, it will run tests and other stuff automatically
leaving you with "target folder". there're some useful thing but you need to go to target>runtime-images>windows
here will be a folder with compiled natgen. ready to release.

if it fails with message that some scary folder doesnt have jmods folder, check pom.xml to put into release-all.bat path to JDK 11.0.2 (i put one into the project) in JAVA_PATH argument
