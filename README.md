# NationGen
Dominions 5 procedural content generation program. It allows you to make nation packs for nationgen games or create content for your mods.

Package includes two batch files (.exe analog): nationgen for creating nations and spritegen for making sprites.

# Updates
Due to Necron being an asshole with many interests and catastrophic decline in natgen popularity in his comminity he is kinda delayed the project. For a person it would like there're no progress, but natgen-n has actually DEV versions, which are not full releases and marked as 'tags'. You still can download them as usual.
