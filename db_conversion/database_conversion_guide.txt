Update the following files from LarzM's Dom5Inspector GitHub (https://github.com/larzm42/dom5inspector):

/db/nations.csv
/db/realms.csv
/db/sites.csv (renamed from MagicSites.csv)
/db/spells.csv
/db/units.csv (renamed from BaseU.csv)
/db_conversion/armors.csv
/db_conversion/attributes_by_armor.csv
/db_conversion/attributes_by_weapon.csv
/db_conversion/effects_weapons.csv
/db_conversion/protections_by_armor.csv
/db_conversion/weapons.csv

Then run nationGen.unrelated.DatabaseConverter, which will generate the following using the files in db_conversion:
/db/armor.csv
/db/weapon.csv

by the way it seems that DBConverter needs old armor.cvs and weapons.cvs in the folder to update them.
